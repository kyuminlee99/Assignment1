    <p><strong>HTML</strong> is the Web&#237;s core language for creating content for everyone to use anywhere. The
      World Wide Web&#39;s markup language has always been HTML. </p>
    <p>HTML was originally designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents, but its general
      design and adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of documents.

  <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>

    <p><strong>Style Sheets</strong> describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they are
      pronounced. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet mechanism that has been specifically developed to meet
      the needs of Web designers and users.</p>

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
      lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
      objects of its environment to provide programmatic
      control over them.</p>

    <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
      Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
      respond to user events
      such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
